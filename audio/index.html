		<h1>Audio</h1>
		
		<p>Doom 64's sound system was built upon the William's Entertainment Sound System (WESS) but adapted for the Nintendo 64 and went by the name of NESS (affectionately known as nessy). The engine ran at a sound quality of 22.05 kHz sample rate, although the sounds themselves were at 11.025 kHz sample rate. The Nintendo 64 interpreted those sounds at 22.05 kHz, thus the raw sounds play back at double the original sample rate. In-engine, however, the sounds were down-pitched by half via nearest-neighbor interpolation to restore their original pitch. For the official Doom 64 Remaster, the 11.05 kHz sounds were upscaled to 22.05 kHz using an interpolation method. Unlike other id Tech engine games of the time, the Doom 64 sounds are 16 bit rather than 8 bit.</p>
		
		<h2>Nintendo 64 Considerations</h2>
		
		<p>Nova's <a href="https://github.com/9nova/d64make">d64make</a> can convert sounds, MIDIs, and soundfonts to formats compatible with the Nintendo 64. None of these assets are stored in the WAD on the Nintendo 64, rather they are stored in three files for the WESS sound system.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>WDD - Audio files</li>
			<li>WSD - Sound playback definitions</li>
			<li>WMD - MIDI music</li>
