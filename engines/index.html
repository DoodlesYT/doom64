		<h1>Engines</h1>
		
			<p>The Doom 64 engine built upon the PlayStation Doom engine which itself came from the Atari Jaguar Doom engine. It utilized the Nintendo 64 (N64) 3D graphics acceleration, thus it is a hardware-rendered version of the engine. As opposed to the earlier Doom games, Doom 64 runs at an engine rate of 30 Hz rather than 35 Hz. Although the source code for Doom 64 was never released publicly, the community would eventually completely reverse engineer the game. With the exception of the official Doom 64 Remaster, all of the Doom 64 engines which natively support its level format are open-sourced and are able to be modified. Doom 64 engines are in two main branches: PC compatible ports and Nintendo 64 compatible ports.</p>
			
		<h2>PC Engines</h2>
		
			<p>Although adaptations of Doom 64 to other Doom engines existed prior, Doom 64 EX was the first engine to use partially reverse-engineered Doom 64 code. It natively supported the Doom 64 map format, which allowed the game to be played with decent accuracy. This has been used as a base for other PC engines including the official Doom 64 Remaster and modern console ports.</p>

		<h2>N64 Engines</h2>
		
			<p>The Doom 64 source code was not fully reverse-engineered until 2020, when then Doom 64 RE was released. This release allowed Doom 64 mods to be made for Nintendo 64 hardware (and emulators). It is compiled with the original Nintendo 64 SDK. Many later forks of this engine have been updated to run on the Modern N64 SDK, which has the latest GNU compiler updates.</p>

		<h2>Other Ports and Adaptations</h2>
			
			<p>There are other forks for the engines not mentioned above and, as Doom 64 is a fork of the Doom engine, adaptations exist to run on other engines. Follow the link below for a more comprehensive list of Doom 64 engines.</p>
